    <p>STOP! JUST WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?!?</p>
    <p>Clicking on random links can be very dangerous. Malicious actors could:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Find out where you live</li>
        <li>Attempt to compromise your machine</li>
        <li>Disable your WiFi</li>
        <li>And so much more...</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Don't become a victim. Install <a href="fail.html">Anti-Grabify</a> for Chrome and never have your IP address stolen again. It's my gift to you!</p>
